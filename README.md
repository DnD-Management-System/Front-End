# D&D Management System, Front End

## Project Description

An intuitive and user-friendly way for Dungeons and Dragons players to manage their characters, including spells and items, allowing more focus to be shifted to the actual play of the game.

## Technologies Used

* Angular - version 12.2.9
* Angular Material - version 12.2.11
* HTML5

## Features

* An intuitive and responsive user interface
* Information communicated in a manner consistent with the expectations of modern users
* Clearly divided information, providing a clearer picture of the information than most physical D&D character sheets

To-Do:

* Integrate with back end for true data persistence
* Implement tools for Game Masters to manage campaigns, including accessing all player characters associated with a campaign
* Implement a login page, allowing the user's role (player or GM) to be managed automatically
